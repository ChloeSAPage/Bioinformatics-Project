# Overview
My first coding assignment for a university project. 

A programme used to compare COVID-19 sequences and determine the putative geographic source. 

It takes two gene sequences, Human-Covid and Bat-Covid and compares the two to find their genetic distance which narrows down the origin of covid-19.
